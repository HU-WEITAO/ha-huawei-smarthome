"""User-contributed protocol for Huawei product KW59 (华为智能门锁E211).

Product: 华为智能门锁E211 (deviceModel ``AGS-E211``, prodId ``KW59``,
deviceTypeId ``A0B``, manufacturer 华为).
Profile: https://smarthome-drcn.dbankcdn.com/device/guide/KW59/KW59.json

Family member of the SmartLock series already covered by this repository
(KW02 / AGS-X10, KW5L, and the KW38/KW4X set from PR #82).  The Profile
declares the same 20 services; ``lockStatus`` and ``event`` carry identical
enum spaces.  All entity logic mirrors the KW02 adapter.

Verification status -- every read below was checked against a live wire
snapshot of a real AGS-E211 (services the lock actually reported):

    lockStatus.status   4 -> 已关门 (updateTime travels alongside)
    batteryManager      lithiumBatteryLevel=22, accumulatorBatteryLevel=92,
                        lpmStatus=0 -- pushed although the Profile does not
                        declare the service at all
    doorBattery/catEyeBattery / lockAlarm / faces(空)
                        declared by the Profile, never pushed (the KW02
                        pitfall, confirmed on this model too)
    netInfo             intensity=100, RSSI=-41
    update              currentVersion "AGS-E211 5.0.0.1(SP43C00)"
    event               {"eid":"2991","das":-1,"up":200,"aid":
                        "...MOTION_DETECTION_...","uic":0} -- 猫眼移动侦测;
                        the aid token identifies it (up=200 is outside the
                        Profile enum, like KW02's loitering 201)
    eventData           {"uic":0,"up":43,"eid":"3013","das":-1} -- 43 is
                        outside the Profile enum (0-33); it arrived one
                        second before lockStatus -> 已关门 with no alarm and
                        no credential, so it reads as a door-close-class
                        operation.  It is deliberately NOT labelled and NOT
                        classified as an unlock; if the vendor App ever shows
                        a name for 43 it can be added as a verified label.
    doorEvent           {"eventType":1,"id":1,"event":7,"userName":"Chris"}
                        -- the event code space is undocumented, so only
                        userName is read.
    lastActionTime      time "20260915T232350Z" (SmartHome stamp)
    users/fingers/ciphers/watchs/walletKeys
                        roster lists pushed on the wire (keyCards/faces
                        declared but empty so far)

Unverified on this model (family-informed, kept from KW02/KW38):

    * unlock operation codes.  0-7 and 24 (门内开锁) come from this product's
      Profile; 35 (室内一握开锁) / 37 (旋钮或钥匙开锁) are codes the KW02
      firmware was observed to use for interior unlocks.  CONFIRMED on the
      AGS-E211 (2026-09-17, real-door test, full automation chain verified):
      an interior knob unlock reported the KW02 code 37 and an outdoor
      fingerprint unlock reported the Profile code 0 -- 开门方向 / 最近开门
      方式 / 门锁事件 all updated correctly for both.
    * the automatic re-lock after an unlock reports up=43 on this lock (the
      unlabelled door-close-class code above), not KW02's 38: the logbook
      shows lockStatus returning to 已关门 with no lock event.  38 stays in
      the lock set on family evidence; 43 deliberately produces nothing.
    * alarm labels (das 1-15) come from the Profile enum; only das=-1 (无
      告警) has been observed on the wire so far.

Read-only on purpose: the Profile declares lockStatus and update.action as
RW, but on the KW02 the firmware acks such writes and ignores them (假成功),
and the vendor App exposes no remote control for the series either.  The lock
entity therefore registers explicit refusal actions -- HA always renders
上锁/解锁 buttons, and pressing them raises a self-explanatory error instead
of the generic "adapter action is unavailable" or, far worse, a silent fake
success.  The refusal never sends anything to the lock (covered by a test),
and OTA stays unmapped entirely.
